Topic: Impacts of Computing

Context: Grade Level 6-8

Outcome: Students will understand and reflect on technology’s place in society. Explain the 
                 positive and negative impact of technology in a variety of social situations. Describe 
     both the positive and negative impacts of technology that has had the most impact on their life.

Overview:
	    Begin the lesson by engaging students in a discussion of how technology makes a 
    difference in their lives. The discussion helps to develop the desired classroom 
    dynamics (collaboration) and skills that will appear throughout the class. This will allow students  
    to describe verbally or in written format how technology has impacted their lives, to compare and 
    contrast their answers to an adult answer. 

Learning Activities: 
	     Discuss issues of bias and accessibility in the design of existing technologies. 
	  		What would one find most difficult to do without technology?

	     Collaboration through strategies such as crowdsourcing (the practice of 
     obtaining a computational artifact (is something created by a human using a 
     computer and can be, but is not limited to, a program, an image, audio, a video, a 
     presentation). 
	Does it make a difference what the application/computing is for?

     Describe tradeoffs between allowing information to be public and keeping 
     information private and secure. 
	How computing is affecting personal privacy and the security of 
Organizations?

Assessment:
	     Students are to interview an adult and ask, "What technology has had the most impact on your 
     life? In what ways has your life been affected?" 

     Students will record the adult’s answer and compare and contrast the answer with their own 
     original answer in a brief paragraph.
	
Self-Evaluation:
4. I got it! I understand everything by
 completing a short paragraph (compare & contrast) with a lot of evidence. 

3. I mostly get it! I understand most of it but not all of it by 
	 completing a short paragraph (compare & contrast) with some evidence. 

2. I sort of get it! I am still a little confused by
	 completing a short paragraph (compare & contrast) with little evidence. 

1. I don’t get it! I am confused by
	 completing a short paragraph (compare & contrast) with no evidence.
